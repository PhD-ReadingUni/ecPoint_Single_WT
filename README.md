NOTE: the directory "Data" is stored only locally at ECMWF as it was too big to be stored in GitHub, and it contains rainfall observations that are not supposed to be re-distributed outside ECMWF.
Data is available upon request and authorization to the main author of the paper (fatima.pillosu@ecmwf.int).
